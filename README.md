# Introduction
Customer profiling is crucial for hotel chain to  gain a deeper understanding of its guests. This deeper understanding will, in turn, empower Hotels to deliver highly personalized services, enhance guest satisfaction, and optimize revenue generation. This project focuses on using machine learning to segment different customers into groups and build profile of each group. For this purpose, this project has compiled a detailed dataset from a hotel on the Kaggle, including booking details, customer information, and reservation specifics. The project has used DBSCAN for clustering. The results show that 3 main groups of customer are found, each group has its own characteristics. This project provides insights into leveraging machine learning techniques to create customer profiles, thereby helping to develop appropriate strategies for each customer group.
