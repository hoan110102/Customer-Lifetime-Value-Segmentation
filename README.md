# Introduction
Each individual is different and so are his preferences. With such a diversity of needs and preferences, how do you serve all of them? Most importantly, how as a business do you know which customers to target and form the right marketing strategies for each of them? In this customer-centric world, Segmentation is your answer. Customer segmentation is the act of dividing a particular company’s consumers into groups of consumers who have related needs and characteristics about them. It assists businesses to aim and adapt marketing communication, products and services to fit each group’s requirements. Knowledge of customers’ specific preferences implies improved satisfaction, higher levels of customers’ loyalty and higher sales rates. Thus, a perfect segmentation should be able to support more effective resource management and more engaged consumers, putting the business relatively ahead of its competitors.
In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised machine learning - Clustering on a dataset contains the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.
